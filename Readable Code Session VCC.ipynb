It's tempting to name variables ina quick way by only using one letter, or make it really long to properly explain what it's for, but it's important to mane variables in a clear but concise way. This ensures that if you abandoned your code and someone else picked it up, they would be able to figure out exactly what you meant."

    "Another crucial part of making sure your code can be understood and used by others is commenting.Comments can be used to track who worked on the code and when, what versions the code went through and explain functionality of the code where it's not immediately obvious. It can also help you remind yourself of what your code actually did if you've left it for a long time. In python you can comment a single line by using the # key"

    "\n",
    "Indentation in Python is very important. Unlike C or Java which uses brackets to indicate a block of code, Python uses indentation. Without this, Python doesn't know when a piece of code begins or ends and will cause an indentation error when running. Indentations are used for if/else statements, loops or functions. The notation used for indentation in Python either uses one tab button or 4 spaces (this is down to personal preference). Just don't use a mixture of spaces and tabs as this can cause errors in your code.\n",
